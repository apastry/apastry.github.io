The first season of the Mind of a Chef is brilliant. It has everything you need for an interesting journey through the Foodland: Antony's voice, cheeky David Chang, a lot of fermented food and Christina Tosi's desserts. Focus on flavour and having fun in the kitchen and you will be rewarded - that's what I learned from Milkbar's Mistress. Original recipe contains not lactose free dairy products.


Ingredients.
----------

### Chocolate Crumbs:

* 95 g plain flour
* 5 g cornstarch
* 70 g good cocoa powder
* 100 g caster sugar
* 5 g table salt or sea salt if you want to taste little 'bombs' of sea salt in your pie shell
* 85 g lactose free butter, melted

Heat you oven to 150 C. Combine all your dry ingredients. Pour in melted butter. Stir with a fork or use a food processor to bring together to large clusters of dough. Spread that on a baking tray. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool down.


### Banana Cream Base:

* 250 g very ripe bananas
* 80 g lactose free heavy cream
* 60 g lactose free milk

Puree until smooth. Then add:

* 80 g caster sugar
* 20 g cornstarch
* 3 g table salt
* 3 eggs yolk

Puree until smooth. Pour into a thick bottomed pan. Put the pan on medium heat. Stir constantly until you have thick custard. Meanwhile, bloom 

* 3 gelatin sheets

Squeeze out excess water from gelatin sheets and add to the pan. Add a little bit of yellow food colouring. Blend until smooth. Sieve into a bowl, cover the surface of custard with plastic film and leave to cool.


### Pie Crust:

* 270 g of Cocoa clusters you just baked
* 20 g caster sugar
* 30 g lactose free butter, melted

Blend Cocoa clusters and Caster sugar with food processor. Add melted butter, mix until you get 'a dough'. Press your chocolate dough into a 25 cm pie tin. Make sure to cover the sides. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge to set.

### Banana Cream:

* 175 g lactose free heavy cream
* 140 g icing sugar

Whisk until soft peaks form.

Fold in your Banana cream base that was cooling down.

To assemble the pie:

* 1 banana, sliced
* your pie shell
* your banana cream
* the remaining cocoa clusters

Spread half of the banana cream onto the base of pie shell. Dot with slices of banana. Add the remaining cream. Decorate with cocoa clusters if you want. Set into fridge or freezer to set. You can serve it straight from freezer as almost-an-ice-cream pie or let it defrost before serving. Serve with creme fraiche and bee pollen, Sarah!
